# Plan My Lineup

A simple tool to help coaches plan their youth basketball lineups.

## Overview

Coaching is a fun and rewarding experience, especially when working with youth basketball teams. However, planning a lineup can sometimes be a little stressful. Most leagues require equal playing time for all players. If you have a team of 10 players, rotating between players is pretty straightforward; just swap 5 players each quarter (or half quarter).

However, if you have an odd number of players (or players missing from a game), it can be harder to plan. I developed this tool to make it easier to set lineups and preview what each quarter or period will look like.

## How It Works

This tool takes a simple approach to generating a basketball lineup. Given a list of players, it will take increments of 5 players and add them to a quarter or period (half a quarter). Once the end of the list of players is reached, it will start from the top until 5 players are chosen.
